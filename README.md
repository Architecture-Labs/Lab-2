# Uses Cases :
  - List all Vaccination centers
  - Search for appointment


#  Architecture : 
  ### 1) why do we need Architecture ?
    > If we don't use architecture, we might fall under the risk of writing our codes in an unorganized pattern. This might increase the number of lines of code, making it difficult to understand. It also decreases readability and increases the number of bugs. So, to provide clear data flow which increases robustness, scalability, bug resistance, increases readability, we should use proper architecture, suitable to work in a team.
    The architectural patterns provide the best practices and play a significant role in application development. These patterns are designed to simplify complex codes and make the UI code cleaner and manageable.
